## About Me

I am 21 years old at the moment I live in Russia in the city of Tver. My current job is related to the development of various design projects, which are necessary for the approval of various technical documents in the architecture. I can not say that I like my job, because at heart I want to develop sites, constantly evolve and improve. That is why I start this new path in my life by studying at Rolling Scopes School. Small steps, through all the difficulties to my dream - to be a web developer!

## Skills

* HTML
* CSS
* GIT
* Photoshop, Figma
* Framework (WordPress)

## Code Example

```js
alert("Hello, world!")
```

## Education

I graduated from Bryukhovetsky agrarian college, specialty: Applied Computer Science (by branch).</br>
I always try to develop my skills and knowledge. I study different information in open sources, as well as watching videos of various IT-bloggers.</br>
I study various courses on platforms: Udemy, Stepik.


## Experience

> At the moment, unfortunately, I have no commercial experience in developing websites and apps for large audiences. I have tried many different areas: I worked as a system administrator at school, I was a graphic designer...</br> But in the end I was able to understand what my soul really lies in: code. That feeling, when you could spend hours and hours thinking about how to implement a particular function, going through all the trouble of implementing a feature and realizing - oh yes, it works!

## Languages
At the moment I am learning a little bit of English because it is very important in my future work, as well as in general as a personal development and because English is cool!
My main language is Russian.
